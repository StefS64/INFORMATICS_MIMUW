plot: "In 1935, T. E. Lawrence dies in a motorcycle accident. He receives a memorial service at St Paul's Cathedral, but it becomes clear that many influential Britons dislike him.\n\nDuring the First World War, Lawrence is a misfit British Army lieutenant, notable for his insolence and education. Mr. Dryden of the Arab Bureau sends him to link up with Colonel Harry Brighton, who is advising Prince Feisal in his revolt against the Turks. On the way, Lawrence is outraged when his guide is ruthlessly killed by Sherif Ali bin el Kharish for drinking from his well without permission. He accuses Ali of being an uncivilised barbarian, and is dismayed to learn that Ali is Feisal's advisor.\n\nRelations between the United Kingdom and the Arabs are polite but tense. While Britain will supply guns to the Arabs, it will not provide artillery, which would make Feisal a power player after the war. Brighton asks Feisal to fall back and help the British defend the Suez Canal. Lawrence violates his orders by encouraging Feisal to attack. Feisal is impressed by Lawrence's familiarity with the Quran and honesty about British interests in Arabia.\n\nLawrence convinces Feisal to launch a surprise attack on the port of Aqaba to improve his supply lines. Ali protests, as Aqaba is protected from land attacks by the harsh Nefud Desert and the local Turkish enforcer, Howeitat tribal leader Auda Abu Tayi. Feisal gives Lawrence just fifty men. Lawrence also hires teenage orphans Daud and Farraj as his attendants.\n\nThe march to Aqaba demonstrates Lawrence's cunning and charisma. He wins over Feisal's men by turning back into the desert to rescue Gasim, a lost Arab. The grateful Arabs give Lawrence traditional Arab clothing; Lawrence in turn grows to admire the Arab civilisation. In addition, Lawrence convinces Auda to switch sides by promising him a vast Turkish gold hoard at Aqaba. The Arabs begin relying on Lawrence, as an outsider, to arbitrate tribal disputes. Lawrence is shaken when he is forced to execute Gasim to prevent an all-out conflict.\n\nLawrence and Auda capture Aqaba, but there is no gold. To placate Auda, Lawrence agrees to ask his superiors in Cairo for more money. On the way, he loses Daud in quicksand.\n\nIn Cairo, Lawrence perplexes the British officers with his Arab clothes and his insistence that Farraj be treated with the same respect as a white person. General Edmund Allenby promotes him to major and agrees to back the Arabs with arms and money. Lawrence confesses that he is worried about his own bloodthirstiness, but Allenby dismisses his concerns. Before heading back, Lawrence asks Allenby whether the Arabs are correct that the British seek to dominate Arabia, and demands artillery for Feisal's army. To please Lawrence, Allenby lies to him on both counts. He privately worries that Lawrence has \"gone native\".\n\nLawrence launches a guerrilla war to harass the Turks. The American media romanticises Lawrence's exploits and makes him famous, as the Americans are looking to highlight the \"more adventurous aspects\" of war to help draw the United States into the fight. In reality, Lawrence's recklessness and bloodthirstiness get many of his soldiers killed. Ali urges him to slow down, but Lawrence—who has developed a saviour complex—ignores him. On one raid, Farraj is badly injured. Lawrence is forced to kill him to save him from the Turks, who torture their captives.\n\nThe Turks capture Lawrence while he covertly scouts the Turkish-held city of Deraa.[a] They do not recognise him, but the Turkish Bey orders him stripped, ogled, prodded, and beaten—and, it is implied, raped. The Turks throw the injured Lawrence into the street. Ali rescues him and nurses him back to health. The experience leaves Lawrence shaken and humbled. He returns to British Cairo, but does not fit in.\n\nWith the Turks on the back foot, Dryden informs Lawrence about the Sykes–Picot Agreement, a secret treaty to partition the Middle East between Britain and France after the war. Allenby urges Lawrence to return to Arabia to support the \"big push\" on Damascus. Lawrence feels betrayed, but reluctantly complies. He recruits a mercenary army with little interest in Arab liberation. Lawrence hopes that if the Arabs can take Damascus before the British, they will have enough leverage to demand an independent Arab state after the war.\n\nLawrence's army sights a column of retreating Turkish soldiers who have just massacred the residents of Tafas. One of Lawrence's men is from Tafas and demands no prisoners. Ali insists on proceeding to Damascus, but the man charges alone and is killed. Lawrence takes up the dead man's battle cry, and the Arabs massacre the Turks. After the battle, Lawrence looks at his own reflection in disbelief, having become the image of the barbarity he once condemned Ali for.\n\nThe Arabs beat the British to Damascus. To protect their independence, Lawrence asks them to run the city without British support. His plan fails. The tribesmen bicker constantly, the public utilities fail, and the understaffed hospitals can barely function. A British medical observer furiously criticises the situation in front of Lawrence and slaps him, although he does not recognise him. Feisal coldly discards Lawrence's dream of Arab independence in exchange for British support and a promotion from prince to king.\n\nLawrence bitterly returns to the British Army, where, ironically, the medical observer greets him as a hero. To get rid of Lawrence, the British promote him to colonel and order him back to Britain. As he leaves the city, he looks longingly at the departing Arabs before his car is passed by a motorcyclist, who leaves a trail of dust in his wake."
