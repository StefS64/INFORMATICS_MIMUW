Packing killer lines, killer needledrops, and killer, er, killers too, not only is this a rollicking ride in its own right, but it also set the blueprint for everything we've come to expect from a Tarantino joint.

And Harold Ramis, directing and co-writing with Danny Rubin, manages to spin gold from the well-worn thread of a man stuck in time. Whilst this time-loop dramedy might not have been the first film to drink from this particular trope's well, it is inarguably head and shoulders above the rest. Murray's customarily snarky delivery gets the easy laughs flowing early doors, but it's the way the movie finds deeper things to say about existence and morals as it goes on, all whilst never feeling overly preachy or worthy, that keeps us coming back to it again, and again, and again.",/additional_info/groundhog-day-1993,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GncQtURdcE4

Matching wits with Hugh Grant's moustache-twirlingly evil and deliciously outré washed-up actor Phoenix Buchanan, Paddington (Ben Whishaw) is on typically adorable form here as his search for a special present for his Great Aunt Lucy leads to all sorts of hilarious hijinks.

Played out against the beautiful mountain landscapes of Wyoming (or, in reality, the Canadian Rockies), the decades-spanning love story between shepherds Ennis Del Mar (Ledger) and Jack Twist (Gyllenhaal) — two men who unexpectedly find love on the titular mountainside, only to find it tested over the years as societal mores and heteronormative expectations work against them — is sensually observed and immaculately shot. Not only does it give you hope and break your heart in equal measure, but the multiple Oscar-winning movie's impact on queer cinema continues to be felt today.

That the film, with all its heavy themes and brooding atmosphere, manages to eventually land on a note of overwhelming optimism is a testament to Kelly's mercurial moviemaking.

Inarguably, its greatest strength however isn't Reno, or even Gary Oldman's unhinged baddie Stansfield, but a very young Natalie Portman, who delivers a luminous, career-creating performance as vengeful 12-year-old Mathilda.

Made with all the relentless tension of a slasher (after all, what is Arnie's Terminator if not Michael Myers in leathers?) and the kinetic thrills of a balls-to-the-wall blockbuster, nothing has been the same since the T-800 told Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor ""Come with me if you want to live”.",/additional_info/the-terminator-1984,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k64P4l2Wmeg

The result is a tense, slow, and mysterious take on the chase movie format, lensed immaculately by legendary DP Roger Deakins. It's also a film that thoughtfully considers the question of how — or even if — good people can ever hope to deal with a world that's entirely gone to shit.

But this is no mere jump-scare chiller, not by a long stretch. In fact, the real reason it continues to affect audience so deeply today is because of the way Friedkin, through the figures of Fathers Damien Karras (Jason Miller) and Lankester Merrin (Max von Sydow), so skilfully stages a soul-shaking crisis of faith, sustaining and building an atmosphere of such dread, such spiritual torment, that you can't help but feel you've unleashed something satanic simply by watching it.",/additional_info/the-exorcist-1973,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU2eYAO31Cc

And you have to live the rest of your life like a schnook, because, frankly, no other film compares toGoodfellas. The only solution: another big snort ofGoodfellas. Scorsese, writer Nicholas Pileggi and editor Thelma Schoonmaker constructed almost the entire film like a trailer, one scene bleeding into the next, not giving you the opportunity to stop watching, to let go, to take a breath. It’s an unstoppable feat of propulsion. Nowthat’s cinema.",/additional_info/goodfellas-1990,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo5jJpHtI1Y
9) Raiders Of The Lost Ark (1981),Steven Spielberg,https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/01/raiders-of-the-lost-ark.jpg?auto=format&w=1440&q=80,"Harrison Ford, Karen Allen, Paul Freeman, John Rhys-Davies","In '81, it must have sounded like the ultimate pitch: the creator ofStar Warsteams up with the director ofJawsto make a rip-roaring, Bond-style adventure starring the guy who played Han Solo, in which the bad guys are the evillest ever (the Nazis) and the MacGuffin is a big, gold box which unleashes the power of God.

8) Avengers: Infinity War (2018),"Directors:Anthony Russo, Joe Russo",https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/05/2-infinity-war.jpg?auto=format&w=1440&q=80,"Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson, Chadwick Boseman, Chris Hemsworth, Sebastian Stan, Josh Brolin","It was the biggest crossover event in cinematic history, and the biggest cliffhanger we never saw coming. After ten years and eighteen movies, Marvel took superhero filmmaking to a new level when they united all of Earth's mightiest heroes (and several more) against The Mad Titan himself – and incredibly, devastatingly, they lost.Infinity Warcrashed much-loved characters into each other's orbits, flitting between planets at breakneck speed as the Avengers desperately tried to stop Thanos from clicking his fingers and wiping out half the universe. Spectacular action, punch-the-air moments and big-scale battles are perfectly balanced, as all things should be, with hilarious interplays and aching emotion. Cinema doesn't get much bigger, or better, than this.",/additional_info/avengers-infinity-war-2018,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZfuNTqbHE8
7) Pulp Fiction (1994),Quentin Tarantino,https://images.bauerhosting.com/legacy/empire-images/features/560ebc9b50e6c513721c30e0/pulp-fiction-tarantino.jpg?auto=format&w=1440&q=80,"Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis","AfterReservoir Dogsannounced Tarantino as a blistering new voice in American indie cinema, the filmmaker took everything that made his debut great and expanded on it. Across a set of interweaving tales, a host of hitmen, armed robbers, fixers and an ageing boxer find themselves entangled in stories of death, drugs, and lucky escapes in '90s LA – all interspersed with self-aware conversations on pop culture, religion, and the nature of crime itself. It's about everything and nothing at once, an exercise in pure style but with substance to match, and dialogue so memorable that entire chunks have entered the cultural consciousness at large.Pulp Fictionembodies everything that made early '90s independent cinema (and Tarantino himself) so exciting and fresh – playful and unexpected, steeped in genre knowledge, the coolest images set to the coolest soundtrack. And with truly iconic performances from John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Bruce Willis and more, the whole thing is an embarrassment of cinematic riches. Somehow both of its time and entirely timeless,Pulp Fictionjust never gets old.",/additional_info/pulp-fiction-1994,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZAhzsi1ybM
6) Jaws (1975),Steven Spielberg,https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/01/jaws.jpg?auto=format&w=1440&q=80,"Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfuss","The impact ofJawssimply cannot be overstated. It created the notion of the summer blockbuster. It made millions feel it wasn’t safe to go back in the water. And, for all the clear potential of his early work, it well and truly put Spielberg on the map. It was, famously, nightmarish to shoot — waterlogged, behind schedule, over budget, and with a mechanical shark that kept breaking. But for all that churn beneath the surface, what the audience sees is effortless brilliance — a tense, beautifully-shot shark-attack thriller with deeply-layered characters, outstanding dialogue, and heart-stopping moments forever burned in the cultural landscape. Roy Scheider is utterly believable as vulnerable everyman police chief Martin Brody, forced to face the reality of a murderous shark on the shores of Amity Island, teaming up with Richard Dreyfuss’ preppy marine biologist Hooper and Robert Shaw’s salty sea-dog Quint to blow it to bits. Their chemistry steers the entire ship — sure, the scary set-pieces are outstanding, but so too is Quint’s haunting USS Indianapolis monologue. But the real star here isn’t them, or even Bruce the shark — it’s Spielberg himself. The eerie shark POV shots. The mind-bending dolly zooms. The head popping out of the boat. His work here is a pure display of cinematic mastery from first minute to last — the head, the tail, the whole damn thing.",/additional_info/jaws-1975,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pxkU9GVAoA
5) The Shawshank Redemption (1994),Frank Darabont,https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/2-shawshank-redemption.jpg?auto=format&w=1440&q=80,"Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, William Sadler","The warm, leathery embrace of Morgan Freeman's narration... The reassuringly Gary Cooper-ish rumple of Tim Robbins' face... Odd that a movie which features such harshness and tragedy should remain a feel-good perennial — even odder when you consider it was a box-office flop on release. Few directorial debuts are so deftly constructed; no surprise, then, that Frank Darabont has yet to top it.",/additional_info/the-shawshank-redemption-1994,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hB3S9bIaco
4) The Dark Knight (2008),Christopher Nolan,https://images.bauerhosting.com/legacy/empire-images/articles/5b71a3a625ad1b591a09a89e/dark-knight.jpg?auto=format&w=1440&q=80,"Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Gary Oldman","And away… we… go! After constructing a whole new Gotham inBatman Begins, Christopher Nolan introduced the clown intent on tearing the whole thing down. Despite being aBatmanmovie (albeit the first ever not to have 'Batman' in the title),The Dark Knightis absolutely The Joker's show – the late, great Heath Ledger (an initially controversial choice) putting in a visceral, transformative, truly terrifying performance as the Clown Prince Of… not exactly Crime, but pure, unadulterated Chaos. Less than a decade after 9/11, Nolan re-conceived Batman's greatest foe as an unpredictable terrorist intent on turning the people of Gotham against each other – his actions intended to spark mass discord pulled off in jaw-dropping set-pieces. For all the spectacle, this is a very different blockbuster from the off – the genius opening clown-mask bank heist is the film in miniature, an ambitious crime saga clad in superhero trappings, daring and ruthless and full of surprises.The Dark Knightis full-strength, no-holds-barred, firing-on-all cylinders Nolan, and not just an all-time great comic book movie, but an all-time great movie period — as the movie's rightful high ranking here attests.",/additional_info/the-dark-knight-2008,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXeTwQWrcwY

At once an arthouse drama and a commercial blockbuster,The Godfathermarked the dawn of the age of the mega-movie. An icon of the gangster genre, it’s imprinted in popular culture – ""Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes"", the horse's head in the bed – but the first instalment of Brando's cotton-cheeked patriarch's fight for power is so much more thanthose moments. With performances, style and substance to savour, it managed to both smash box office records andlive onas a staple of cinematic canon.",/additional_info/the-godfather-1972,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x0GpEZnwa8
2) Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (1980),Irvin Kershner,https://images.bauerhosting.com/legacy/empire-images/features/57641535823490d06264a8e0/Empire-Strikes-Back.jpg?auto=format&w=1440&q=80,"Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams, David Prowse","IfStar Warsgave us a whole new cinematic galaxy, Empire made that galaxy feel so much larger, deeper, and richer. Bolstered by the original's success, George Lucas shot for the moon a second time around, teaming up with director Irvin Kershner to tell the story of Luke training under Master Yoda, Han and Leia heading to Cloud City, and Darth Vader dropping the daddy of all twists.Episode Vramped up the scope with more astonishing model work, dizzying dogfights, the snowy Hoth battle, and a ferocious lightsaber duel between Luke and Vader. It is, simply, bigger and better than the originalStar Wars, influential in its own right with its downer-ending and game-changing familial revelations. We love it.

It might have taken 20 years for Peter Jackson's plucky fantasy to clamber, Mount-Doom-style, to the very pinnacle of our greatest-movies pantheon. But here it is, brighter and more resplendent than ever.The Fellowship Of The Ringcontains so much movie. Even at the halfway point, as the characters take a breather to bicker in Rivendell, you already feel sated, like you've experienced more thrills, more suspense, more jollity and ethereal beauty than a regular film could possibly muster up.
