plot: "Jack Torrance takes a winter caretaker position at the remote Overlook Hotel in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, which closes every winter season. After his arrival, manager Stuart Ullman informs Jack that a previous caretaker, Charles Grady, killed his wife, two young daughters and himself in the hotel a decade prior.\n\nIn Boulder, Jack's son, Danny, has a premonition and seizure. Jack's wife, Wendy, tells the doctor about a past incident when Jack accidentally dislocated Danny's shoulder during a drunken rage. Jack has been sober ever since. Before leaving for the seasonal break, the Overlook's head chef, Dick Hallorann, informs Danny of a telepathic ability the two share, which he calls \"shining\". Hallorann tells Danny that the hotel also has a \"shine\" due to residue from unpleasant past events and warns him to avoid Room 237.\n\nA month passes and Danny starts having frightening visions, including of the murdered Grady twins. Meanwhile, Jack's mental health deteriorates; he suffers from writer's block, is prone to violent outbursts, and has dreams of killing his family. Danny gets lured to room 237 by unseen forces, and Wendy later finds him with signs of physical trauma for which she blames Jack. Jack sulks in the ballroom, where ghostly bartender Lloyd entices him back to drinking. Wendy tells him that Danny was attacked by a \"crazy woman\" in room 237. Jack investigates and encounters a hideous female ghost in the bathroom but tells Wendy he saw nothing. He blames Danny for inflicting the bruises on himself and reacts angrily when Wendy suggests leaving the hotel. Danny enters a trance and telepathically contacts Hallorann. Returning to the ballroom, Jack finds it filled with ghostly figures including waiter Delbert Grady, who urges Jack to \"correct\" his wife and child.\n\nWendy finds Jack's manuscript written with nothing but countless repetitions of the proverb “All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy”. When Jack threatens her life, Wendy knocks him unconscious with a baseball bat and locks him in the kitchen pantry, but she and Danny cannot leave because Jack previously sabotaged the hotel's two-way radio and snowcat. Back in their hotel room, Danny says “redrum” repeatedly and writes the word in lipstick on the bathroom door. Wendy sees the word in the mirror and realizes that it is actually “murder” spelled backward.\n\nJack is freed by Grady and goes after Wendy and Danny with an axe. Danny escapes outside through the bathroom window, and Wendy fights Jack off with a knife when he tries to break through the door. Hallorann, having flown back to Colorado from his Florida vacation, reaches the hotel in another snowcat. His arrival distracts Jack, who ambushes and murders him in the lobby, then pursues Danny into the hedge maze. Wendy runs through the hotel looking for Danny, encountering the hotel's ghosts and a vision of cascading blood from an elevator similar to Danny's premonition.\n\nIn the hedge maze, Danny carefully backtracks to mislead Jack and hides behind a snowdrift. Jack plunges onward without a trail and becomes lost. Danny and Wendy reunite and leave in Hallorann's snowcat, leaving Jack to freeze to death in the maze.\n\nIn a photograph in the hotel hallway, Jack is pictured standing amidst a crowd of party revelers from July 4, 1921."
