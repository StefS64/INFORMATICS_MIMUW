plot: "In Toronto, Scott Pilgrim, a 22-year-old bass player for unsuccessful indie garage band Sex Bob-Omb, is dating Knives Chau, a 17-year-old high-school student, much to the disapproval of his friends in the band, his roommate Wallace Wells, and his younger sister Stacey Pilgrim. Scott meets Ramona Flowers, an American Amazon delivery girl, after having first seen her in a dream. Scott loses interest in Knives but does not break up with her before pursuing Ramona. When Sex Bob-Omb plays in a battle of the bands sponsored by record executive Gideon Graves, Scott is attacked by Ramona's ex-boyfriend Matthew Patel. Scott defeats Patel and learns that he must defeat her remaining seven  evil exes in order to date Ramona.\n\nScott finally breaks up with Knives, who blames Ramona and swears to win him back, by becoming more like Ramona. Scott defeats the next three of Ramona's exes: Hollywood actor and skateboarder Lucas Lee, super-powered vegan Todd Ingram, and lesbian ninja Roxy Richter, while also confronting his own ex, pop star Envy Adams. Scott grows frustrated during the process, and after an outburst regarding Ramona's dating history, she breaks up with him.\n\nAt the next battle of the bands, Sex Bob-Omb defeats Ramona's fifth and sixth evil exes, twins Kyle and Ken Katayanagi, earning Scott an extra life. Despite this, Ramona appears to get back with her seventh and final evil ex, Gideon. Sex Bob-Omb accepts Gideon's record deal, except for Scott, who quits the band in protest. Gideon invites Scott to his venue, the Chaos Theater, where Sex Bob-Omb is playing. Resolving to win Ramona back, Scott challenges Gideon to a fight for her affection, earning the \"Power of Love\" sword. \n\nKnives interrupts the battle, attacking Ramona, and Scott is forced to reveal that he cheated on both of them. Gideon kills Scott, and Ramona visits him in limbo to reveal that Gideon has implanted her with a mind control device. Scott uses his 1-up to come back to life and re-enters the Chaos Theatre. He makes peace with his friends and challenges Gideon, this time for himself, gaining the \"Power of Self-Respect\" sword. After apologizing to Ramona and Knives for cheating on them and accepting his own faults, Scott joins forces with Knives and they defeat Gideon. Now free from Gideon's  control, Ramona prepares to leave. Knives accepts that her relationship with Scott is over and, at her encouragement, he leaves with Ramona to \"try again\"."
