plot: "Having found a home with the Brown family in Windsor Gardens, Paddington Brown begins working to buy a pop-up book of London in Samuel Gruber's antique shop for his aunt Lucy's centenary. Paddington performs several odd jobs such as window cleaning and saves his wages. One night, he witnesses a burglary at the shop in which the book is stolen. In pursuit of the thief, Paddington is framed and arrested, while the real culprit, actor Phoenix Buchanan, escapes with the book. With no evidence of the thief's existence, Paddington is convicted and sentenced to 10 years in Portobello Prison.\n\nKnuckles McGinty, the prison chef, hires Paddington to work in the kitchen after tasting one of his marmalade sandwiches. Meanwhile, the Browns help to prove Paddington's innocence by putting up sketches of the thief all over London, while Buchanan uses clues within the book to locate a hidden fortune. Growing suspicious of Buchanan, Mary and Henry Brown search his home and discover a secret attic filled with numerous costumes, including the one he wore during the burglary. They present the evidence to the police, who decline it. Meanwhile, Paddington is ultimately convinced that the Browns have forgotten him.\n\nPaddington and Knuckles, along with two other inmates Phibs and Spoon, escape the prison at midnight. While Paddington's fellow escapees had initially promised to help prove his innocence, they later reveal that their true intention is to flee the country, prompting Paddington to abandon them. Paddington uses a public telephone to contact the Browns, who inform him that Buchanan is the real thief. Aiming to expose Buchanan, they arrange to meet at Paddington station, where a carnival train carrying the hidden fortune is due to depart.\n\nPaddington boards the train immediately before it leaves, and the Browns follow him in an LNER Peppercorn Class A1. Buchanan locks Paddington inside the train's caboose and severs the coupling before Henry subdues him. The caboose rolls into a nearby river with Paddington trapped inside, but Knuckles, Phibs, and Spoon arrive and help Mary save Paddington. \n\nPaddington falls into a coma, but wakes up on Lucy's birthday to find himself at home. He learns that he has been exonerated, Buchanan has been arrested, and the book is now in police custody as evidence of Buchanan's crimes. Much to his delight, he also discovers that the Browns and their neighbours had arranged for Lucy to visit London herself."
