**Plot:** The commercial space tug Nostromo is returning to Earth with a seven-member crew in "stasis" (suspended animation): captain Dallas, executive officer Kane, warrant officer Ripley, navigator Lambert, science officer Ash, and engineers Parker and Brett. The ship's computer, Mother, detects a transmission from a nearby planet and awakens the crew. Following company policy to investigate transmissions indicating intelligent life, they land on the planet. Dallas, Kane, and Lambert discover the transmission comes from a derelict alien spaceship. Inside is a large, mummified alien corpse with a hole in its torso. Later, Mother partially deciphers the transmission, which Ripley determines is a warning beacon and not an SOS as originally thought.

Kane enters a chamber containing hundreds of large eggs. When he touches one, a spider-like creature springs out, penetrates his helmet, and attaches to his face. Dallas and Lambert carry the unconscious Kane back to the Nostromo. Ripley refuses to allow them aboard, citing quarantine regulations, but Ash overrides her. While Parker and Brett work on ship repairs, Ash attempts to remove the creature from Kane's face. He stops when he discovers that its highly corrosive acidic blood could harm Kane and potentially damage the ship's hull. The creature eventually detaches itself and dies. After the crew returns to space, Kane awakens and seems well. During a final crew meal before returning to stasis, he suddenly chokes and convulses. A small alien creature bursts from his chest, killing him, and escaping into the ship.

After ejecting Kane's body into space, the crew uses tracking devices to locate and kill the creature. Brett follows the ship's cat, Jones, into a landing leg compartment, [10] where the now fully-grown alien kills Brett. It is determined that the alien is using the air ducts. Dallas enters one with a flamethrower to force the creature into an airlock, but it kills him. Lambert suggests fleeing in the small shuttle, but it will not support four people. Ripley, now in command, decides they will flush out the alien.

While accessing Mother, Ripley discovers that the company secretly ordered Ash to return with the alien for study and to deem the crew expendable. She confronts Ash, who attempts to kill her. Parker intervenes, knocking Ash's head loose, revealing him to be an android. The survivors reactivate Ash's head, and he confirms the company's orders. Ash states that the alien cannot be killed and expresses admiration for it, taunting them about their chances of survival. Ripley shuts Ash down and Parker incinerates him.

The crew decides to self-destruct the Nostromo and escape in the shuttle. The alien kills Parker and Lambert as they gather supplies. Now alone, Ripley initiates the ship's self-destruct sequence, but the alien blocks her path to the shuttle. She retreats and unsuccessfully attempts to abort the self-destruct. She reaches the shuttle with Jones, narrowly escaping as the Nostromo explodes.

As Ripley prepares for stasis, she discovers the alien has stowed itself in a narrow compartment. She dons a spacesuit and fires a grappling hook gun to push it out. The alien hangs onto the door frame, prompting Ripley to activate the engines, blasting the alien into space. After recording her final log entry, she places Jones and herself into stasis for their return to Earth.
