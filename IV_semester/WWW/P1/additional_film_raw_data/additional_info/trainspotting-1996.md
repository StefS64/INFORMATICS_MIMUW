**Box Office:** $72 million(£48 million)

**Country:** United Kingdom

**Plot:** Mark Renton, a 26-year-old unemployed heroin addict living with his parents in Leith, regularly takes drugs with his "friends": treacherous, womanising James Bond fanatic Simon "Sick Boy" Williamson; docile and bumbling Daniel "Spud" Murphy; and Swanney—"Mother Superior"—their dealer. Renton's other friends include aggressive alcoholic psychopath Francis "Franco" Begbie, and honest footballer Tommy Mackenzie, who both abstain from drug use, warning him about his dangerous drug habit. 

Tiring of his reckless lifestyle, Renton attempts to wean himself off heroin with a bare room, foodstuffs, and opium suppositories from dodgy dealer Mikey Forrester. Developing diarrhoea, he has to relieve himself in the disgusting toilet of a betting shop, then imagines swimming in the filthy water as he retrieves the suppositories.

Renton attempts to lead a "useful and fulfilling" life away from heroin. This consists of meeting Sick Boy in a park where he uses an air gun to incite a stranger's dog to attack its owner, supplying Spud with amphetamine for a job interview that backfires, and stealing a sex tape of Tommy and his girlfriend, Lizzy. 

At The Volcano nightclub, Renton notices his cessation of heroin use has increased his libido. So, he seduces Diane Coulston, returning to hers to have sex. The following morning, he is horrified to learn that she is underaged and lives with her parents, whom Renton mistakes for her flatmates. Diane threatens to blackmail him for statutory rape if he does not continue the relationship.

After several unsuccessful attempts to reintegrate into society, Renton, Sick Boy, and Spud relapse into heroin use; Tommy also begins to join them after Lizzy dumps him, thanks to the actions of an unknowing Renton. Despite the group’s shock, grief, and horror regarding the negligence-induced death of Dawn, the infant daughter of Sick Boy and Allison, they still do not quit using. 

When Renton, Sick Boy, and Spud are caught shoplifting, Sick Boy narrowly escapes. Arrested, Spud receives a six-month custodial sentence at HMP Saughton, and Renton narrowly avoids jail by entering a drug rehabilitation programme where he is given methadone to help him. However, Renton quickly relapses and nearly dies of a heroin overdose at Swanney's. 

Returning home after his revival at the hospital, Renton's parents lock him in his childhood bedroom and force him to go cold turkey. Following severe withdrawal punctuated by hallucinations of his friends and visions of Dawn crawling on the ceiling, Renton is released upon the condition of an HIV/AIDS test. Despite years of sharing syringes with other addicts, he tests negative.

Now clean but bored and lacking meaning in his life, Renton visits Tommy, who is now severely addicted to heroin and is HIV-positive. On Diane's advice, Renton moves to London and works as a property letting agent. He begins to enjoy his new life of sobriety in London and corresponds with Diane, who updates him on home developments. 

To Renton's shock and frustration Begbie, wanted for a failed armed robbery, finds him, taking refuge in his apartment. Sick Boy, now trying to be a pimp and drug dealer, soon joins them. The freeloaders later attack two of Renton's clientele (at a supposedly impossible-to-sell property where Renton has sent them to get peace), so he loses his job. The trio returns to Edinburgh to avoid police attention and for Tommy's funeral, who has died of AIDS-related toxoplasmosis.

Following the funeral, Sick Boy asks Renton, Begbie, and Spud (recently released from prison) for help in buying two kilograms of pure heroin from Mikey Forrester, for only £4,000, to sell on, with Renton needing to supply the remaining £2,000 asking price. He reluctantly covers it after Begbie threatens him. 

So, the four return to London to sell the heroin to a dealer for £16,000. As they celebrate in a pub, Renton secretly suggests to Spud that they take off with the money. He, motivated by fear and loyalty, refuses. Sick Boy indicates he would happily do so, and Begbie brutally beats a man after a minor accident. 

Concluding that Begbie and Sick Boy are too volatile, Renton quietly steals the bag of money and leaves the following morning. Spud sees, but chooses not to warn the others. Renton leaves £4,000 in a left-luggage locker for Spud, who "never hurt anybody". 

Begbie, discovering Renton and the money gone, enragedly destroys their hotel room, prompting the police to arrest him as Sick Boy and Spud flee. Spud discreetly claims his share of the money, and Renton walks away to his new life.
