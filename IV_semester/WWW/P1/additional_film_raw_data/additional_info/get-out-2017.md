**Plot:** On a suburban street at night, a Black man walks alone, talking on the phone. A car pulls up to the curb beside him; sensing trouble, the man starts to walk away. A person wearing a helmet that conceals his face tackles the man, subdues him, drags him into the car, and drives away.

Chris Washington, a Black photographer, travels to upstate New York for a weekend getaway to meet the family of his White girlfriend, Rose Armitage. He has uncomfortable conversations with her parents, Dean, a neurosurgeon, and Missy, a psychiatrist. Later, Rose's brother Jeremy arrives and shares embarrassing stories about Rose at dinner. Chris also observes eerie, unnatural behavior from the family's Black servants, Georgina and Walter.

Missy tricks Chris into having a hypnotherapy session with her, using the noise of a spoon stirring in a teacup as a hypnotic trigger, ostensibly to cure his smoking addiction. While in a trance, Chris reveals that his mother was killed in a hit-and-run when he was a child, and he feels guilty because he waited too long to call for help. At Missy's prompting, Chris' consciousness falls into a dark void she calls the "sunken place," where his body becomes temporarily paralyzed. The next morning, Chris no longer has a desire to smoke. 

Dozens of wealthy white guests arrive for the Armitages' annual get-together, and their remarks about Chris cause him to feel uncomfortable. Chris meets a blind art dealer, Jim Hudson, who takes an interest in his photography, and Logan King, another Black man whom Chris finds oddly familiar. Like Walter and Georgina, Logan behaves unnaturally, and he is married to a White woman thirty years older than him. When Chris tries to photograph Logan, the camera flash causes Logan to become hysterical, rushing at Chris and shouting frantically for him to "get out." Logan is taken away by Dean, who later claims Logan had a seizure.

The party guests hold a silent auction, with Chris as the "prize", where Hudson makes the winning bid. Chris sends a photo of Logan to his friend, TSA officer Rod Williams, who recognizes Logan as Andre Hayworth, a missing man from Brooklyn. Chris discovers photos of Rose with numerous Black people, including Walter and Georgina, contradicting her claim that he is the first Black person she has dated. Chris tries to leave, but Rose refuses to give him the car keys. Jeremy blocks the door, and Missy uses the hypnotic trigger to send Chris back to the sunken place.

Chris awakens strapped to an armchair in the basement. In a video, Hudson explains that the family transplants the brains of their wealthy friends into others' bodies to acquire their desired physical characteristics, leaving the hosts' consciousnesses trapped in the sunken place. Hudson says transplanting their brains into Black people is the latest "fad", but clarifies that he does not care about Chris's race; he only wants Chris's eyesight. Meanwhile, Rod, who has been trying to contact Chris and suspects foul play, goes to the police, but they do not believe his theory about the Armitages.

Missy attempts to hypnotize Chris again, but he blocks the trigger by plugging his ears with cotton stuffing from the armchair. He bludgeons Jeremy, kills Dean and Missy, and finishes off Jeremy when he attacks again. Dean's death inadvertently causes a fire that presumably burns an unconscious Hudson alive. Chris tries to escape in Jeremy's Porsche but accidentally hits Georgina, who has the brain of Rose's grandmother, Marianne. Compelled by guilt over his mother's death, he goes back to help her, but she attacks him, causing the car to crash and killing her.

Rose and Walter, who has the brain of Rose's grandfather, Roman, arrive to capture Chris. During a scuffle, Chris uses his phone's flash to briefly free Walter from Roman's control. Walter takes Rose's rifle, shoots her, and fatally shoots himself. Chris starts strangling Rose, but cannot bring himself to kill her. A police car arrives and Chris surrenders, but Rod emerges from it. He picks up Chris, leaving Rose bleeding on the road.
