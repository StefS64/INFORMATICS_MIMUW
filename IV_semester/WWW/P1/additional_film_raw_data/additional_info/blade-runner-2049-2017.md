**Plot:** In 2049, 30 years after the events of Blade Runner, bioengineered humans known as replicants are still used for slave labor. K (short for serial number, KD6-3.7), a Nexus-9 replicant, works for the Los Angeles Police Department as a "blade runner", an officer who hunts and "retires" (kills) rogue replicant models.

After retiring replicant Sapper Morton, K finds a box buried under a tree at Morton's farm. It contained the remains of a female replicant who died during a caesarean section. This demonstrates that replicants could reproduce biologically, previously thought impossible. K's superior, Lt. Joshi, fears this knowledge could lead to war between humans and replicants, so she orders K to retire the replicant child.

K visits the Wallace Corporation, successor to the defunct Tyrell Corporation in the manufacture of replicants. DNA archives identify the deceased female as Rachael, an experimental Nexus 7 replicant. K learns of Rachael's romantic ties with former blade runner Rick Deckard. CEO Niander Wallace wants the secret to replicant reproduction to expand interstellar colonization. He sends his replicant enforcer, Luv, to monitor K.

At Morton's farm, K finds the date 6.10.21 carved into the tree trunk and recognizes it from a childhood memory of a wooden toy horse. Because replicant memories are artificial, K's holographic A.I. girlfriend Joi believes this is evidence that K was born, not created. K discovers in LAPD records two children born on that date with identical DNA aside from the sex chromosome, but only the boy is listed as alive. K tracks the child to an orphanage but the records from that year are missing. K recognizes the orphanage from his memories and finds the toy horse in the furnace where he remembers hiding it. Replicant memory designer Dr. Ana Stelline confirms that his memory of the orphanage is authentic, leading K to conclude he is Rachael's son. K then fails a baseline test, marking him as rogue. When he implies to Joshi that he killed the replicant child, she gives him 48 hours to pass the test, or he will be 'retired'.

Joi hires replicant prostitute Mariette as a surrogate for her to have sex with K. The following morning, Mariette places a tracker on K's jacket prior to being sent away by a jealous Joi. Analysis of the toy horse leads K to the ruins of a radioactive Las Vegas. There he finds Deckard, who informs him he is the father of Rachael's child and scrambled the birth records to protect their offspring's identity. Deckard left the child in the custody of the replicant freedom movement. Luv kills Joshi and tracks K to Las Vegas. She kidnaps Deckard, destroys Joi, and leaves a weakened K behind. Using Mariette's tracker, the replicant freedom movement rescues K. When their leader, Freysa, discloses to him that Rachael's child was a girl, K deduces that Stelline is her daughter and that the toy horse memory is hers. Fearing Deckard may give up Stelline or the freedom movement to Wallace, Freysa urges K to kill him.

Luv takes Deckard to meet Wallace, who offers Deckard a duplicate Rachael in exchange for information about his child's whereabouts. He refuses, so Luv kills the duplicate. As Luv transports Deckard to be tortured off-world, K intercedes. He fights and drowns Luv but is severely wounded in the process.

K stages Deckard's death to protect him from Wallace and the replicant freedom movement before taking Deckard to Stelline's office and handing him her toy horse. As K dies on the steps looking up at the falling snow, Deckard enters the building and tearfully meets his daughter for the first time.[a]
