**Plot:** The film opens with a scene of couples dancing the Jitterbug.

A woman is about to be shot by her chauffeur, but is saved when a car crashes into them at night on Mulholland Drive. The woman is the sole survivor. Dazed, she hides in a vacant apartment. The next morning, Betty Elms, an aspiring actress from Deep River, Ontario, arrives at the apartment, which her aunt has lent her. She finds the woman, who has amnesia but remembers she is in danger. For convenience, the woman adopts the name "Rita" from a Gilda poster featuring Rita Hayworth. Betty and Rita discover a large quantity of cash and a blue key in Rita's purse.

At Winkie's diner on Sunset Boulevard, a man tells his friend about a recurring nightmare in which a horrific figure waits for him in the alley behind the diner. His friend dismisses it, but the two investigate the alley anyway. The figure appears as predicted, and the man collapses in shock.

Film director Adam Kesher is threatened by mobsters who want him to cast unknown actress Camilla Rhodes as the lead in his new project, The Sylvia North Story. When he refuses, the mobsters shut down the production. Adam returns home and finds his wife in bed with another man. After a scuffle, his wife's lover throws him out of his own house. His personal assistant offers to let him stay with her and unsubtly offers sex, but he politely declines. He is pressured into meeting a man dressed as a cowboy, who urges him to cast Camilla for his own good. Elsewhere, incompetent hitman Joe Messing is forced to kill two bystanders to cover up a theft.

After meeting a waitress named "Diane" at Winkie's, Rita remembers the name "Diane Selwyn". Betty finds Diane's address in the phone book, but leaves Rita to attend an audition, where she does marvelously. The casting agent brings her to meet Adam, who is auditioning actresses for The Sylvia North Story. The two lock eyes, but Betty flees after remembering she promised to meet Rita. Adam reluctantly casts Camilla to please the mob.

Betty and Rita visit Diane Selwyn's apartment, but the occupant recently swapped apartments with Diane. The two break into Diane's new apartment and discover a woman's decomposing corpse in the bed. Horrified, Rita tries to cut her hair off, but Betty persuades her to instead don a blonde wig similar to Betty's own hairstyle. They have sex and fall asleep, but Rita wakes them both up when she chants "silencio, no hay banda" (Spanish for "silence, there is no band") in her sleep.

Rita insists on visiting Club Silencio immediately. There, Betty and Rita watch a surrealist performance art piece, in which a trumpeter and singer Rebekah Del Rio mime and lip-sync performances that are eventually revealed to have been pre-recorded. The idea terrifies Betty. After Rebekah's performance, Betty discovers a blue box in her purse matching Rita's key, and the two women return home. Rita is about to unlock the box, but finds that Betty has vanished. After unlocking the box, Rita also vanishes.

Diane Selwyn, a depressed and struggling actress who looks exactly like Betty, awakens in the apartment Betty and Rita investigated. Her neighbor visits to pick up her things and warns that detectives are looking for Diane. Diane daydreams about Camilla Rhodes, a successful actress who looks exactly like Rita. She cries after recalling that Camilla broke up with her.

Camilla invites Diane to a party at Adam's house on Mulholland Drive. There, Diane meets Adam's mother, who looks exactly like Betty's landlady. Diane explains that she moved to Los Angeles with money she inherited from her deceased aunt and that she met Camilla when they both auditioned for the lead in The Sylvia North Story. It is revealed that Adam cast Camilla as the lead in a film; that Adam and Camilla are now dating; and that Camilla threw the party to announce their engagement. In addition, Camilla publicly kisses her mistress, who looks exactly like the "Camilla Rhodes" from the mobster subplot. Diane shakes with rage.

Diane meets Joe Messing at Winkie's (where a waitress is named "Betty") and hires him to kill Camilla. He promises to leave Diane a blue key as a sign that the job is done. Later, a traumatized Diane stares at the blue key on her coffee table. Terrorized by hallucinations, she runs into her bedroom and shoots herself. At Club Silencio, a blue-haired woman whispers "silencio".
