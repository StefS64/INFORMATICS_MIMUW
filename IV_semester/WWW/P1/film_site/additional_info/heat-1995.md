**Box Office:** $187.4 million

**Country:** United States

**Plot:** Neil McCauley is a professional thief based in Los Angeles. He and his crew—right-hand man Chris Shiherlis, enforcer Michael Cheritto, driver Gilbert Trejo and newly hired hand Waingro—rob $1.6 million in bearer bonds from an armored car. During the heist, Waingro kills a guard without provocation, forcing the crew to eliminate the other two guards. McCauley prepares to kill Waingro in retaliation for the deaths of the guards, but he escapes.

LAPD Lieutenant Vincent Hanna and his team investigate the robbery. Hanna, a dedicated lawman and former Marine, has a strained relationship with his third wife Justine, and struggles to connect with his stepdaughter Lauren. McCauley, who lives a solitary life, begins a relationship with Eady, a graphic designer. They bond over their mutual isolation from society, and, claiming to be a salesman, McCauley asks her to emigrate to New Zealand with him.

McCauley's fence Nate suggests that he sell the stolen bonds to their original owner, money launderer Roger Van Zant. Van Zant pretends to agree but instead arranges an ambush. Anticipating a trap, McCauley and his crew counter-ambush and kill the hitmen. Afterward, McCauley threatens Van Zant with revenge. An LAPD informant connects Cheritto to the robbery, and Hanna's team begins monitoring him, identifying the rest of the crew and their next target, a precious metals depository. The team stakes out the depository, but when a careless officer makes a noise, McCauley aborts the heist.

McCauley's crew agrees to one last bank robbery worth $12.2 million. Hanna tracks McCauley and pulls him over on the 105 Freeway, inviting him to coffee. They discuss their dedication to their respective jobs and the limitations of their personal lives; Hanna describes his failing marriage, and McCauley confides that he is similarly isolated. Despite their mutual respect, both men acknowledge that they will kill the other if necessary. Waingro makes a deal with Van Zant to help eliminate McCauley's crew. Trejo quits the bank robbery at the last moment, claiming that the LAPD is following him too closely. McCauley recruits old colleague Don Breedan to take Trejo's place as the getaway driver, and the crew carries out the heist.

Tipped by Van Zant's bodyguard, the LAPD intercepts the crew as they leave the bank, leading to a massive shootout. Breedan and Cheritto are killed alongside many police officers, while McCauley escapes with a wounded Shiherlis, and Bosko, one of Hanna's detectives, is killed. McCauley takes Shiherlis to a doctor to treat his wounds and leaves him with Nate. Suspecting that Trejo tipped off the LAPD, McCauley arrives at his house to confront him, but finds him mortally wounded and his wife killed.

Before asking McCauley to kill him, Trejo reveals that Waingro and Van Zant forced him to divulge the bank heist plans. McCauley breaks into Van Zant's mansion and kills him. After learning of McCauley's connection to Waingro and that the latter is hiding in a hotel, Hanna uses Waingro as bait to lure McCauley. As McCauley prepares to flee the country, Eady discovers his criminal identity but agrees to go with him. Before escaping, Shiherlis attempts to reconcile with his wife Charlene after his wife has been forced by the LAPD to bring him in. As Shiherlis encounters Charlene at her safe house, she warns him away with a hand gesture, and he escapes.

Having separated from Justine, Hanna finds Lauren in his hotel room, having attempted suicide. He rushes her to the hospital and saves her life. Hanna reconciles with Justine, although they both agree that their relationship will never work.

McCauley drives with Eady to the Los Angeles International Airport to flee to New Zealand via private jet. However, when Nate gives him Waingro's location, McCauley abandons his usual caution to seek revenge. McCauley infiltrates the hotel and kills Waingro in his room. However, as McCauley returns to Eady, he is spotted by Hanna and flees. Hanna chases McCauley onto the tarmac at the airport, and the two stalk each other before Hanna gets the drop on McCauley and shoots him in the chest. Hanna takes McCauley's hand as he dies of his wounds.
