**Plot:** Sightless aliens (dubbed "Death Angels") with sharp hearing and impenetrable armored skin have taken over the planet and killed most of the human population. The Abbott family – mother Evelyn, father Lee, deaf daughter Regan, and sons Marcus and Beau – live on their isolated farm in the middle of a forest in upstate New York, and have survived by taking precautions such as laying sand paths to avoid stepping on crunching leaves and using American Sign Language when communicating.

When the family goes into the nearby town for supplies, Beau finds a toy space shuttle, but Lee makes him leave it behind due to the noise it would make if powered on. As they are getting ready to leave, Regan secretly gives him back the toy, but without its batteries. When they leave, Beau takes back the batteries without anyone noticing. While walking back home, Beau turns on the space shuttle, which starts making noise. Almost immediately, Beau is killed by a nearby Angel before Lee can reach him. Regan suffers terrible guilt thereafter, which she hides from her parents, although Marcus is aware of it.

Over a year after Beau's death, the family has seemingly gone back to normal, with Evelyn several months pregnant. Marcus reluctantly goes fishing with Lee while Regan, upset that she cannot go, visits Beau's grave. While the rest of the family is gone, Evelyn goes into labor. While heading to the basement, she accidentally steps on an upright nail and drops a photo frame, alerting a nearby Death Angel which enters the house. Struggling to stay silent amidst the pain, Evelyn flips a switch in the basement, turning the surrounding lights around the house red. The Angel enters the basement soon after, but Evelyn distracts it with the loud clicks of an egg timer and escapes upstairs. Upon returning to the farm and seeing the red lights, Marcus and Lee lure the Angel out of the house by lighting off fireworks, allowing Evelyn to safely give birth to her baby.

Regan, seeing the fireworks, runs back to the house. Lee enters the house armed with a shotgun and finds the baby and Evelyn, then brings them into a hiding spot under the floor in the barn outside. The baby cries, alerting a Death Angel into the barn. The Angel fails to find the source, but breaks some water pipes. Evelyn wakes up in the flooded hideout with the Death Angel still inside and hides behind the falling water to mask her and the baby's sound.

Marcus and Regan climb to the top of a corn silo and light a signal fire to alert their father, but Marcus falls into the silo and almost becomes sucked into the corn. Hearing this, the Death Angel, which is hunting for Evelyn, 
runs towards the silo and attacks Regan and Marcus. The creature's disruptive effect on electronics causes Regan's cochlear implant to emit a high-pitched noise, which causes the creature to reel in pain and retreat, breaking a hole in the silo which frees the children. Lee finds Regan and Marcus, directing them to his truck,[4] and is wounded when an Angel attacks him. Marcus cannot stifle a scream, and the Death Angel attacks the truck. Lee signs to Regan that he has always loved her and proceeds to yell to draw the Angel's attention, sacrificing himself to the Angel in order to allow Marcus and Regan to drive the truck back to the house safely.

Reuniting with a grieving Evelyn and hearing the sounds of a nearby Death Angel, they make their way back into the house and enter the basement, into which the Angel follows them. Regan, remembering the reaction the Angel had to the high-pitched noise from her implant, places the implant on a microphone which amplifies the noise. The Angel screeches in pain and exposes the vulnerable tissue beneath the armor plating on its head, allowing Evelyn to kill it with Lee's shotgun, though the sound of the shot alerts nearby Angels. Armed with a new weapon, the family prepares to defend themselves from the approaching group of Death Angels.
