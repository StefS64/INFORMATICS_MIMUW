**Plot:** In 1941, Austrian SS-Standartenführer Hans Landa interrogates French dairy farmer Perrier LaPadite about a fugitive Jewish family, the Dreyfuses. Landa boasts about his nickname, "The Jew Hunter," then urges LaPadite to give up the Dreyfuses for the safety of his own family. After LaPadite tearfully admits that they are hiding under his floorboards, Landa directs his men to massacre them. One of them, young Shosanna, escapes unharmed.

Three years later, U.S. Army Lieutenant Aldo Raine recruits Jewish-American soldiers to the "Basterds," a black ops commando unit tasked with instilling fear among Nazis in occupied France by killing and scalping them. The group includes Sergeant Donny "The Bear Jew" Donowitz, Privates First Class Smithson Utivich and Omar Ulmer, rogue German Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz, and Austrian-born translator Corporal Wilhelm Wicki. In Germany, Adolf Hitler interviews a German soldier, who reveals that Raine carved a swastika into his forehead after massacring his squad. Raine leaves this mark on all surviving German soldiers as a way to make their Nazi affiliations clear even after the war.

In Paris, Shosanna operates a cinema under the name Emmanuelle Mimieux, and meets Fredrick Zoller, a famed German sniper set to star in the German propaganda film Stolz der Nation (Nation's Pride). Infatuated with "Emmanuelle," Zoller convinces Joseph Goebbels to hold the film's premiere at her cinema. Landa, as the premiere's head of security, interrogates Shosanna but does not reveal if he recognizes her. She plots with her Afro-French lover and projectionist, Marcel, to kill the German leaders by burning down the cinema with her collection of highly flammable nitrate films.

British Commando Lieutenant Archie Hicox, a former film critic and fluent German speaker, is recruited for Operation Kino, an attack on the premiere with the Basterds. Disguised as German officers, Hicox, Stiglitz, and Wicki meet with German film star Bridget von Hammersmark, an undercover Allied agent, at a tavern in Nazi-occupied northern France. Hicox's unusual accent arouses suspicion from Wehrmacht Sergeant Wilhelm and Major Dieter Hellström, and he blows the group's cover with a non-German hand gesture. A gunfight ensues, killing everyone except Wilhelm and a wounded von Hammersmark. Raine arrives and negotiates for von Hammersmark's release, giving her a chance to shoot Wilhelm. Raine tortures von Hammersmark, believing she set his men up, but she convinces him of her loyalty to the Allies and reveals that Hitler will be attending the premiere. She proposes that Raine, Donowitz and Ulmer attend the premiere posing as Italian filmmakers, remarking that Germans do not recognize Italian accents. Landa investigates the tavern and finds von Hammersmark's shoe and a napkin with her signature.

The Basterds infiltrate the premiere with timed explosives. Landa, who is fluent in Italian, readily sees through their cover and confronts von Hammersmark with her missing shoe before strangling her to death. He has Raine arrested along with Utivich, whom he has also detected, but leaves Ulmer and Donowitz in the theater. Recognizing the opportunity of his situation, Landa offers to let the attack proceed if Raine's OSS commanders will guarantee his safety after the war. Raine contacts his commanders and Landa negotiates a generous deal for himself and his radio operator.

During the screening, Zoller slips away to the projection booth and berates Shosanna for rejecting his advances, leading them to shoot each other dead. As Nation's Pride reaches its climax, Shosanna's face appears on the screen telling the Nazi audience that they are about to be killed by a Jew. Having locked the auditorium, Marcel ignites a pile of nitrate film behind the screen with his cigarette, setting the theater ablaze. Ulmer and Donowitz break into the opera box, gunning down Hitler and Goebbels and firing into the crowd until their explosives kill everyone inside the cinema, including themselves. Donowitz spends his last seconds unloading his submachine gun into Hitler's face.

Landa and his radio operator drive Raine and Utivich into Allied territory, where they surrender to Raine. Raine casually shoots the radio operator, infuriating Landa for breaking the terms of the deal, but Raine shrugs off his outrage. Utivich and Raine admit that they would make the same deal given the choice, then carve a swastika into Landa's forehead that Raine dubs his "masterpiece."
